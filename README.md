# GPAKE Android Client

# Run
This is very simple to run, just build the gradle project in Android Studio. Please note at this stage, the ip address must be entered manually into the code. It can be located in the JPAKEPlus, SPEKEPlus, and JPAKEPlusEC files stored in the serverAddress variable. Please also adjust MainActivity.java if you wish to test connection to the server by sending a message.
<br />
Please follow the instructions in the README.md on the following project https://github.com/Bhavik-Makwana/GPAKEIoTAuthentication
